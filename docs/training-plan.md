## Training Notes & Adjustments

### Weather & Winter Considerations

- **Nov-Feb:** Expect cold, wet conditions. Prioritize safety over schedule
- If conditions are dangerous, substitute with indoor alternatives or rest
- 2 quality runs per week is better than 3 mediocre runs
- Layer properly; invest in reflective gear for dark runs

### Injury Prevention

- Listen to your body - better to skip one run than miss 2 weeks
- If anything hurts for more than 2 runs in a row, take extra rest
- Ice and stretch after hard efforts
- Consider strength training 1-2x/week (lunges, squats, planks)

### Pace Guidelines

- **Easy runs:** 6:30-6:50 min/km (conversational, can chat)
- **Long runs:** 6:30-6:45 min/km (steady, comfortable)
- **Tempo runs:** 6:00-6:10 min/km (comfortably hard, controlled breathing)
- **Intervals:** 5:35-5:45 min/km (hard effort, 80-85% max)
- **Race pace:** 5:50 min/km (target pace for half marathon)

### Weekly Structure Template (Phase 2+)

- **Sunday:** Long run (key workout of the week)
- **Monday:** Rest (always rest after long run)
- **Tuesday:** Tempo/Interval OR easy run
- **Wednesday:** Rest
- **Thursday/Friday:** Easy run (maintenance)
- **Saturday:** Rest
